# IT-Spend-Analysis-Project
# *The IT Spend Analysis Project aims to analyze and compare actual IT expenditures against planned budgets across various IT areas within an organization. The primary goal is to identify areas where spending has deviated from the budget, understand the reasons behind these variances, and provide actionable insights for better financial management.*

# Introduction
# This project involves analyzing the actual and planned IT expenditures across different areas such as Infrastructure, BU Support, Functional, Governance, and Enablement. The analysis reveals that most areas have exceeded their planned budgets, with the exception of Functional, where actual expenditure is less than the planned budget. Detailed variance analysis has been conducted to provide insights into these discrepancies.
